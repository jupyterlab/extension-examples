## TL;DR

The goal of this repository is to show how to develop extensions for [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), presented as short tutorial series.

To get started:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples.git jupyterlab-extension-examples

# go to the extension examples folder
cd jupyterlab-extension-examples

# create a new environment
conda env create

# activate the environment
conda activate jupyterlab-extension-examples

# go to the hello world example
cd hello-world

# Required to deal with Yarn 3 workspace rules
touch yarn.lock

# install the extension in editable mode
python -m pip install -e .

# install your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite

# build the TypeScript source after making changes
jlpm run build

# start JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

The examples currently target **JupyterLab 4.0 or later**.

If you would like to use the examples with JupyterLab 3.x, check out the [3.x branch](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/tree/3.x).

If you would like to use the examples with JupyterLab 2.x, check out the [2.x branch](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/tree/2.x).

If you would like to use the examples with JupyterLab 1.x, check out the [1.x branch](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/tree/1.x).

Note that the `1.x`, `2.x` and `3.x` branches are not updated anymore.

## Develop by Examples

You may find it easier to learn how to create extensions _by examples_, instead of going through the documentation.

Start with the [Hello World](hello-world) and then jump to the topic you are interested in.

### Dual Compatibility

The dual compatibility examples demonstrates how to design an extension that can be
integrated similtaneously in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook v7+.

They are listed from the simplest to the most advanced case:

- [Top Area Text Widget](#top-area-text-widget): Example working right away in both frontends.
- [Shout Button](#shout-button): Example with a part only available in JupyterLab
- [Clap Button](#clap-button-message): Example with elements added differently depending on
  the frontends used.

#### [Top Area Text Widget](toparea-text-widget)

A very simple example that adds a basic text widget to the top area. See [related video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqotG1MkHa4).
This example is part of the [Extension Dual Compatibility Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension_dual_compatibility.html).

[![Top Area Text Widget](toparea-text-widget/preview.jpg)](toparea-text-widget)

#### [Shout Button](shout-button-message)

This example shows dual compatibility: Make an extension that is compatible
with both JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook by using optional features. Adds
a shout button to the right sidebar, and if running in JupyterLab, also adds
a status bar widget. This example is part of the [Extension Dual Compatibility Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension_dual_compatibility.html).
Read more about this example on that page.

[![Dual compatibility shout button](shout-button-message/preview.jpg)](shout-button-message)

#### [Clap Button](clap-button-message)

This example shows an alternate method for achieving dual compatibility: Make an
extension that is compatible with both JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook by exporting
multiple plugins and using "required" features to select different behaviors. Adds a clap button to
the top area (in JupyterLab) or the right sidebar (Jupyter Notebook). This example is part
of the [Extension Dual Compatibility Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension_dual_compatibility.html).
Read more about this example on that page.

can depend on and reuse features from one another. The three packages
that make up the complete example are "step_counter", "step_counter_extension",
and "leap_counter_extension".

Consumer Pattern". This is one of three related extension examples
that demonstrate JupyterLab's provider-consumer pattern, where plugins
can depend on and reuse features from one another. The three packages
that make up the complete example are "step_counter", "step_counter_extension",
and "leap_counter_extension".

[![Step counter](step_counter/preview.png)](step_counter)

### [Step Counter Extension (Reusability 1B)](step_counter_extension)

## Prerequisites

Writing an extension requires basic knowledge of JavaScript, Typescript and potentially Python.

_Don't be scared of Typescript, even if you never coded in TypeScript before you touch
JupyterLab you may find it easier to understand than pure JavaScript if you have a
basic understanding of object oriented programming and types._

These examples are developed and tested on top of JupyterLab.
You can create a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment to get started
after cloning this repository.

```bash
conda env create && \
  conda activate jupyterlab-extension-examples
```

> The previous command will use the [environment.yml](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/blob/main/environment.yml) file as requirements for the environment.

## Develop and Use the Examples

### Build and Install all Examples at once

```bash
jlpm
jlpm build-ext
jlpm install-py
jlpm install-ext
jupyter lab
```

To rebuild all the extensions:

```bash
jlpm build-ext
```

To clean the lib folders:

```bash
jlpm clean-ext
```

### Build and Install one Example

Go to the example directory you want to install, e.g. `cd ./hello-world`, and run the following commands:

```bash
touch yarn.lock
pip install -e .
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

Rebuild the extension:

```bash
jlpm run build
```

You can now start JupyterLab and check if your extension is working fine:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### Change the Sources

If you want to develop and iterate on the code, you will need to open 2 terminals.

In terminal 1, go to the extension folder and run the following:

```bash
jlpm watch
```

Then in terminal 2, start JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

From there, you can change your extension source code, it will be recompiled,
and you can refresh your browser to see your changes.

We are using [embedme](https://github.com/zakhenry/embedme) to embed code snippets into the markdown READMEs. If you make changes to the source code, ensure you update the README and run `jlpm embedme` from the root of the repository to regenerate the READMEs.

### Update extension template

Execute from the example root folder:

```sh
./scripts/update-template.sh
```

Then fix the conflicts.

## Test the Examples

The examples are automatically tested for:

- Homogeneous configuration:
  Configuration files are compared to the reference ones of the _hello-world_ example
- TypeScript code lint
- Installation in JupyterLab:
  The installation is checked by listing the installed extension and running JupyterLab with the helper `python -m jupyterlab.browser_check`
- Integration test:
  Those tests are emulating user action in JupyterLab to check the extension is behaving as expected.
  The tests are defined in the `ui-tests` subfolder within each example.
  This is possible thanks to a tool called [playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## Install a Published Extension

Once your extension is published on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) (outside of this scope), you can install it
with the following command:

```bash
pip install <published_extension>
```

## About JupyterLab

JupyterLab can be used as a platform to combine existing data-science components into a
new powerful application that can be deployed remotely to many users. Some of the higher
level components that can be used are text editors, terminals, notebooks, interactive widgets,
filebrowser, renderers for different file formats that provide access to an enormous ecosystem
of libraries from different languages.

Complementary to these examples, you can rely on the official JupyterLab documentation.
