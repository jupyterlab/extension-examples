# Step Counter (Reusability 1A) (step_counter)

This multi-part example comes from the [Jupyter Plugin System guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/plugin_system.html),
and demonstrates Jupyter's provider/consumer pattern. You can find
details about this example on that page.

This is one of three related extension examples that demonstrate
JupyterLab's provider-consumer pattern, where plugins can depend
on and reuse features from one another. The three packages that
make up the complete example are:

1. (\*) The step_counter package (this one). This holds a token, a
   class + an interface that make up a stock implementation of
   the "step_counter" service, and a provider plugin that
   makes an instance of the Counter available to JupyterLab
   as a service object.

2. The step_counter_extension package, that holds a UI/interface
   in JupyterLab for users to count their steps that connects
   with/consumes the step_counter service object via a consumer plugin.

3. The leap_counter_extension package, that holds an alternate
   way for users to count steps (a leap is 5 steps). Like the step_counter_extension
   package, this holds a UI/interface in JupyterLab, and a consumer
   plugin that also requests/consumes the step_counter service
   object. The leap_counter_extension package demonstrates how
   an unrelated plugin can depend on and reuse features from
   an existing plugin. Users can install either the
   step_counter_extension, the leap_counter_extension or both
   to get whichever features they prefer (with both reusing
   the step_counter service object).
