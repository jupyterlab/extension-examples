// This is one of three related extension examples that demonstrate
// JupyterLab's provider-consumer pattern, where plugins can depend
// on and reuse features from one another. The three packages that
// make up the complete example are:
//
//   1. (*) The step_counter package (this one). This holds a token, a
//      class + an interface that make up a stock implementation of
//      the "step_counter" service, and a provider plugin that
//      makes an instance of the Counter available to JupyterLab
//      as a service object.
//   2. The step_counter_extension package, that holds a UI/interface
//      in JupyterLab for users to count their steps that connects
//      with/consumes the step_counter service object via a consumer plugin.
//   3. The leap_counter_extension package, that holds an alternate
//      way for users to count steps (a leap is 5 steps). Like the step_counter_extension
//      package, this holds a UI/interface in JupyterLab, and a consumer
//      plugin that also requests/consumes the step_counter service
//      object. The leap_counter_extension package demonstrates how
//      an unrelated plugin can depend on and reuse features from
//      an existing plugin. Users can install either the
//      step_counter_extension, the leap_counter_extension or both
//      to get whichever features they prefer (with both reusing
//      the step_counter service object).
